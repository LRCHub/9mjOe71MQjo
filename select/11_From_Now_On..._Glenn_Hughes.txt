I've been thinkin' 'bout what you said
I hear your voice
It speaks inside my head
You know I'd rather be with you
And feel your touch
When I was lost
I knew you'd rescue me
I paid the cost
And now I finally see
And now I know that this was meant to be
It's all too much

Now I'm walkin' down the lonely road
And your face is all I see
I can't imagine that your love would come my way

Chorus:

I need shelter from the storm
I'll be stronger from now on...
I need shelter from the storm
I'll be stronger from now on...

I was lookin' for the chosen way
I was prayin' that I'd hear you say
Now it's time to let it go
It's all in my mind
Now the time has come
This had to be
When the mountains fall into the sea
And you'll be waitin' there for me
Everytime

As I wander in the fields of hope
As I see the light of day
I can't imagine that your love
Would come my way

I need shelter from the storm...

Now I'm walking down the lonely road...

I need shelter from the storm...

From now on my love will be stronger
From now on my faith will be stronger
From now on my soul will be stronger
From now on...
