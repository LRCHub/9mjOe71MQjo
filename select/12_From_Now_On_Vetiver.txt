For old times sake,
He pressed his luck,
Unconvinced by very much

An honest man,
Whose instincts failed
To belie his views
A veil, blind enough to see

From now on
Few secrets wear their disguise
I know where you stand
Weary of suggestion,
An open hand

So where are we tonight?
Take me there
Voices raised, glasses high
Moving to a sound, barely lit
Finally time loses sight,
Wanders off home
Leaves me to pay the bill

Pay up!
It's your turn
From now on
