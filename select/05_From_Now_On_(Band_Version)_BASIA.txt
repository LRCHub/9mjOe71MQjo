Once upon a time it was for real
Nothing mattered---then we were together
And I couldn't ask for more
My dream came true
You were nearest to my heart
I can't make you love me anymore
Nothing matters now when you are gone
Tried so many times before
Only now I understand
We never felt the same
But I don't mind I don't mind
A better combination won't be hard to find
Got to learn to walk again
It's so new---being free
Start the life of different kind
No more us
From now on it's---me
I know this empty room too well
I've got to plan my new life's resolutions
First of all I show you how I can survive
I never knew that I could laugh like this
So I don't mind I don't mind
A better combination won't be hard to find
Got to learn to walk again
It's so new---being free
Start the life of different kind
No more us
From now on it's---me
I don't mind (x16)
Got to learn to walk again
It's so new---being free
Start the life of different kind
No more us
From now on it's---me
Once upon a time it was for real
Nothing mattered then we were together
You were nearest to my heart
Only now I understand
We never felt the same
I don't mind
