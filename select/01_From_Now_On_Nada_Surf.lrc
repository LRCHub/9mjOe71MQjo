[00:00.37] Here comes the hot feeling again
[00:03.98] When I hear his name
[00:07.29] I clearly have no control
[00:10.18] Can't help wondering
[00:20.18] 
[00:14.23] If herein gone like a wave
[00:17.22] I forget but then start rememberin'
[00:20.78] The devil in my mind, why can't he go home?
[00:23.49] Are we on our way?
[00:32.49] 
[00:27.81] I do not want to be in this song
[00:30.80] Sung while the summer rots and the hots hot
[00:35.97] Where is the wind?
[00:38.73] Why does it feel still again?
[00:41.36] Can't think along these lines
[00:45.32] I'm gonna live a long time
[00:48.15] Not along these lines
[00:52.16] I'm gonna live a long time
[01:05.16] 
[00:54.89] When it goes black it goes black so fast
[00:58.98] No good state lasts
[01:01.17] What I get slow is how to bounce back
[01:08.28] You'll have to invent what you lack
[01:25.78] 
[01:14.86] Now it's hunting season for sleeping demons
[01:18.32] I want your attention, your invention
[01:21.81] For every new reason, do you know how I need it?
[01:45.81] 
[01:28.06] But oh your face and everything that you say
[01:33.15] And oh your face and everything that you say
[01:38.39] And oh your face and everything that you say
[02:00.39] 
[01:43.05] I almost thought you stopped talking to me
[01:47.10] Your call came like a wave of relief
[01:50.43] I'm such a lucky mess
[01:54.28] I just need some rest
[02:04.78] 
[01:57.13] Take me along
[02:01.38] From now on
[02:03.95] Take me along
[02:08.24] From now on
[02:13.74] 
[02:13.37] I'm gonna live a long time
[02:19.97] I'm gonna live a long time
[02:25.95] I'm gonna live a long time
